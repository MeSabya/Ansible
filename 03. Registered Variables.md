In Ansible, registered variables are used to capture the output or results of a task and then make that data available for later use within the playbook. This can be particularly useful when you need to perform additional actions based on the result of a task.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept of registered variables:

```yaml
---
- name: Example of Registered Variables
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Run a Command and Capture Output
      command: echo "Hello, Ansible!"
      register: command_output

    - name: Display the Captured Output
      debug:
        var: command_output.stdout
```
