## what is the purpose of set_fact ?

Purpose of set_fact in Ansible
The set_fact module in Ansible is used to define variables dynamically during playbook execution. Unlike vars, which are static and defined before execution, set_fact allows you to create variables on the fly based on conditions, calculations, or previous task results.

<details>
### Why Use set_fact?

- Store Dynamic Values → Create and modify variables at runtime.
- Reuse Computed Data → Use output from previous tasks in later tasks.
- Conditional Logic → Set different values based on conditions.
- Loop Accumulation → Build lists or dictionaries dynamically.

  ### Example 1: Using set_fact for Conditional Variables

```yaml
- name: Set OS-specific Variables
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Define package manager based on OS
      set_fact:
        package_manager: "{{ 'apt' if ansible_os_family == 'Debian' else 'yum' }}"

    - name: Print package manager
      debug:
        msg: "The package manager for this OS is {{ package_manager }}"
```

### Example 2: Using set_fact for Loop Accumulation

```yaml
- name: Build a dynamic list
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
    - name: Initialize an empty list
      set_fact:
        user_list: []

    - name: Add users dynamically
      set_fact:
        user_list: "{{ user_list + [item] }}"
      loop:
        - alice
        - bob
        - charlie

    - name: Show final user list
      debug:
        var: user_list
```
### Example 3: Storing Task Output with set_fact

```yaml
- name: Store Command Output
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
    - name: Get Hostname
      command: hostname
      register: hostname_output

    - name: Store hostname in a fact
      set_fact:
        my_hostname: "{{ hostname_output.stdout }}"

    - name: Print the stored hostname
      debug:
        msg: "This system's hostname is {{ my_hostname }}"
```

## What is the purpose of gather_facts 

gather_facts is an Ansible playbook field that collects system information (facts) about target hosts before executing tasks. These facts include details like OS, IP addresses, CPU, memory, disk space, environment variables, etc.
By default, gather_facts is set to yes, meaning Ansible automatically collects these facts at the beginning of each play.

<deatils>
```yaml
- name: Install Packages Based on OS
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: yes
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache on Debian-based Systems
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Install Apache on RedHat-based Systems
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```
