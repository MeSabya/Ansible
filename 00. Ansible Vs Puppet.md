### When to Use Each:

- Ansible: Ansible is often preferred for its simplicity, ease of use, and quick setup. It's a good choice for environments where you need to get things done quickly without much infrastructure overhead. Ansible is particularly suitable for tasks such as application deployment, configuration management, and task automation.

- Puppet: Puppet is well-suited for larger and more complex infrastructures. Its agent-based architecture allows for greater control and reporting. Puppet excels in environments with a need for a more detailed and centralized configuration management system, especially when dealing with a large number of servers.
