## 1. Defining Variables in vars Section (Per Playbook)

You can define variables in the vars section of the playbook and use them in tasks.

Example:

```yaml
- name: Example Playbook
  hosts: all
  vars:
    username: "devops"
    ssh_key_file: "/home/devops/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
    
  tasks:
    - name: Create the user
      user:
        name: "{{ username }}"
        state: present

    - name: Add SSH key
      authorized_key:
        user: "{{ username }}"
        key: "{{ lookup('file', ssh_key_file) }}"
        state: present
```

âœ… All tasks can access username and ssh_key_file as common variables.

## 2. Using vars_files (External Variable Files)
You can store variables in external files and load them in the playbook.

Example:

vars/common_vars.yml

```yaml
username: "devops"
ssh_key_file: "/home/devops/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
```

playbook.yml

```yaml
- name: Example Playbook
  hosts: all
  vars_files:
    - vars/common_vars.yml  # Load variables from external file

  tasks:
    - name: Create the user
      user:
        name: "{{ username }}"
        state: present

    - name: Add SSH key
      authorized_key:
        user: "{{ username }}"
        key: "{{ lookup('file', ssh_key_file) }}"
        state: present
```
âœ… This approach keeps playbooks cleaner and allows variable reuse across multiple playbooks.

## 3. Using host_vars and group_vars (Per Host/Group Variables)
If you need different variables for different hosts or groups, use host_vars/ and group_vars/.

Example:
ðŸ“‚ Directory Structure

```
inventory
group_vars/
  all.yml
host_vars/
  server1.yml
  server2.yml
playbook.yml
```

group_vars/all.yml (For All Hosts)

```yaml
username: "common_user"
ssh_key_file: "/home/common_user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
```

host_vars/server1.yml (For Specific Host)
```yaml
username: "server1_user"
ssh_key_file: "/home/server1_user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
```

âœ… This lets you override variables for specific hosts without modifying playbooks.

## 4. Using set_fact to Define Variables Dynamically
If you need to define a variable during playbook execution, use set_fact.

Example:

```yaml
- name: Set up variables dynamically
  set_fact:
    home_directory: "/home/{{ username }}"

- name: Create a directory for the user
  file:
    path: "{{ home_directory }}/data"
    state: directory
```
âœ… home_directory is computed dynamically and used in later tasks.
