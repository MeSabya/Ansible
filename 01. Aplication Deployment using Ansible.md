Let's create an example of deploying a simple Python web application using Ansible. In this example, we'll assume you have a Flask web application in a Git repository.

```lua
ansible-project/
|-- inventory/
|   `-- hosts
|-- playbooks/
|   `-- deploy_python_app.yml
`-- roles/
    `-- python_app/
        |-- tasks/
        |   `-- main.yml
        `-- files/
            `-- your_python_app_files/
```

###  Ansible Playbook (deploy_python_app.yml):

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy Python Web Application
  hosts: python_servers
  become: true

  roles:
    - name: python_app
```

### roles/python_app/tasks/main.yml (Role Tasks):
```yml
---
- name: Install Python
  apt:
    name: "python{{ python_version }}-dev"
    state: present
  become: true

- name: Clone application repository
  git:
    repo: "{{ app_source_repo }}"
    dest: "{{ app_destination_directory }}"
  become: true

- name: Install application dependencies
  pip:
    requirements: "{{ app_destination_directory }}/requirements.txt"
  become: true

- name: Start the application
  command: "python{{ python_version }} {{ app_destination_directory }}/app.py"
  become: true
```

### inventory/hosts (Inventory):

```ini
[python_servers]
python_server1 ansible_ssh_host=your_server_ip_or_hostname1
python_server2 ansible_ssh_host=your_server_ip_or_hostname2
# Add more servers as needed
```
