Let's create an example of deploying a simple Python web application using Ansible. In this example, we'll assume you have a Flask web application in a Git repository.

```lua
ansible-project/
|-- inventory/
|   `-- hosts
|-- playbooks/
|   `-- deploy_python_app.yml
`-- roles/
    `-- python_app/
        |-- tasks/
        |   `-- main.yml
        `-- files/
            `-- your_python_app_files/
```

###  Ansible Playbook (deploy_python_app.yml):

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy Python Web Application
  hosts: python_servers
  become: true
  vars:
    app_source_repo: https://github.com/yourusername/your-python-app.git
    app_destination_directory: /opt/your-python-app
    python_version: "3.8"  # Specify your desired Python version

  tasks:
    - name: Install Python
      apt:
        name: "python{{ python_version }}-dev"
        state: present
      become: true

    - name: Clone application repository
      git:
        repo: "{{ app_source_repo }}"
        dest: "{{ app_destination_directory }}"
      become: true

    - name: Install application dependencies
      pip:
        requirements: "{{ app_destination_directory }}/requirements.txt"
      become: true

    - name: Start the application
      command: "python{{ python_version }} {{ app_destination_directory }}/app.py"
      become: true
```
