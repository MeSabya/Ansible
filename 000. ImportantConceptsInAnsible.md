## what is the purpose of set_fact ?

Purpose of set_fact in Ansible
The set_fact module in Ansible is used to define variables dynamically during playbook execution. Unlike vars, which are static and defined before execution, set_fact allows you to create variables on the fly based on conditions, calculations, or previous task results.

<details>
### Why Use set_fact?

- Store Dynamic Values → Create and modify variables at runtime.
- Reuse Computed Data → Use output from previous tasks in later tasks.
- Conditional Logic → Set different values based on conditions.
- Loop Accumulation → Build lists or dictionaries dynamically.

  ### Example 1: Using set_fact for Conditional Variables

```yaml
- name: Set OS-specific Variables
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Define package manager based on OS
      set_fact:
        package_manager: "{{ 'apt' if ansible_os_family == 'Debian' else 'yum' }}"

    - name: Print package manager
      debug:
        msg: "The package manager for this OS is {{ package_manager }}"
```

### Example 2: Using set_fact for Loop Accumulation

```yaml
- name: Build a dynamic list
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
    - name: Initialize an empty list
      set_fact:
        user_list: []

    - name: Add users dynamically
      set_fact:
        user_list: "{{ user_list + [item] }}"
      loop:
        - alice
        - bob
        - charlie

    - name: Show final user list
      debug:
        var: user_list
```
### Example 3: Storing Task Output with set_fact

```yaml
- name: Store Command Output
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
    - name: Get Hostname
      command: hostname
      register: hostname_output

    - name: Store hostname in a fact
      set_fact:
        my_hostname: "{{ hostname_output.stdout }}"

    - name: Print the stored hostname
      debug:
        msg: "This system's hostname is {{ my_hostname }}"
```

</details>

## What is the purpose of gather_facts 

gather_facts is an Ansible playbook field that collects system information (facts) about target hosts before executing tasks. These facts include details like OS, IP addresses, CPU, memory, disk space, environment variables, etc.
By default, gather_facts is set to yes, meaning Ansible automatically collects these facts at the beginning of each play.

<details>
```yaml
- name: Install Packages Based on OS
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: yes
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache on Debian-based Systems
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Install Apache on RedHat-based Systems
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```
</details>

## vars
<details>
Defines static variables within a playbook.
Use case: Declare reusable variables.

```yaml
- name: Using vars
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
    my_message: "Hello, Ansible!"
  tasks:
    - name: Print the variable
      debug:
        msg: "{{ my_message }}"
```
</details>

## vars_files
- Includes variables from external YAML files.
- Use case: Keep variables separate from the playbook for better organization.

<details>
```yaml
- name: Load variables from file
  hosts: localhost
  vars_files:
    - vars.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Print variable
      debug:
        msg: "{{ my_var }}"
```
### Example vars.yml file:

```yaml
my_var: "Loaded from file!"
```
</details>

## When 
<details>
Conditionally executes a task based on a variable or fact.
📌 Use case: Run a task only if a condition is met.

```yaml
- name: Conditional Execution
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
    install_nginx: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      when: install_nginx
```
</details>

## until

<details>
Repeats a task until a condition is met.
📌 Use case: Wait for a service to be available.

```yaml
- name: Wait until a file exists
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Check for file
      stat:
        path: /tmp/myfile
      register: file_check
      until: file_check.stat.exists
      retries: 5
      delay: 10
```
</details>

## Real-Time Use Cases for failed_when in Ansible
The failed_when condition in Ansible allows you to customize failure conditions beyond the default exit status.

<details>

### Example1: Handling Non-Zero Exit Codes Gracefully
Use Case: Some commands return non-zero exit codes even when they succeed. You can override Ansible’s default failure behavior.

Example: A command may return exit code 1, but it's not a real failure.

```yaml
- name: Run a command that returns 1 on success
  command: /usr/local/bin/custom_script.sh
  register: result
  failed_when: result.rc != 1  # Treat exit code 1 as success
```

### Ignoring Specific Errors in a Command
Use Case: A command may return a failure code, but it's an expected error that should not stop the playbook.

Example: Ignoring an error if "No such file" appears in the output.

```yaml
- name: Delete a file if it exists
  command: rm /tmp/nonexistent_file
  register: rm_result
  failed_when: "'No such file' not in rm_result.stderr"
```
</details>

## How can you write reusable and modular playbooks using include_tasks and import_tasks?

<details>
Suppose we have an Inventory File (inventory.ini)
```csharp
[webservers]
server1.example.com environment=production
server2.example.com environment=staging
```
Now we need to write a Playbook to Deploy Based on Environment.
Instead of putting everything in one playbook, you can use include_tasks to call separate task files.

### 1️⃣ Create Task Files  

📌 tasks/deploy_production.yaml:

```yaml
- name: Deploy production version
  debug:
    msg: "Production deployment successful!"
```

📌 tasks/deploy_staging.yaml:

```yaml
- name: Deploy staging version
  debug:
    msg: "Staging deployment successful!"
```

### 2️⃣ Main Playbook (deploy.yaml)
```yaml
- name: Deploy application based on environment
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Deploy to production servers
      include_tasks: tasks/deploy_production.yaml
      when: environment == "production"

    - name: Deploy to staging servers
      include_tasks: tasks/deploy_staging.yaml
      when: environment == "staging"
```
</details>

##  Explain the difference between roles and tasks in Ansible.

- ✅ Use Tasks if your playbook is small and does not require reusability.
- ✅ Use Roles if you want modularity, scalability, and reusability.

<details>
Requirement: Deploying a Web Application Using Tasks and Roles in Ansible

### 🎯 Scenario

You need to deploy a web application on multiple servers. The deployment includes:
- ✅ Installing dependencies (Apache, MySQL, and PHP).
- ✅ Deploying the web application files.
- ✅ Configuring Apache with a virtual host.
- ✅ Restarting services when necessary.

### 🔹 Approach 1: Using Tasks in a Playbook
A simple playbook using tasks directly (not modular or reusable).

📌 deploy.yaml

```yaml
- name: Deploy Web Application
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache and PHP
      yum:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - httpd
        - php
        - php-mysql
        - mysql-server

    - name: Start Apache and MySQL
      service:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: started
        enabled: yes
      loop:
        - httpd
        - mysqld

    - name: Deploy Web Application
      copy:
        src: /home/user/app/
        dest: /var/www/html/
        owner: apache
        group: apache
        mode: 0755

    - name: Configure Virtual Host
      template:
        src: vhost.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/httpd/conf.d/app.conf
      notify: Restart Apache

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
```

### 💡 Limitations:
- 🔴 Not reusable for other applications.
- 🔴 Hard to manage if configurations grow.

### 🔹 Approach 2: Using Roles (Modular & Reusable)
Instead of defining everything in a single playbook, we split it into roles.

### 1️⃣ Define the Role Structure
```css
roles/
 ├── webapp/
 │   ├── tasks/
 │   │   ├── main.yaml
 │   ├── handlers/
 │   │   ├── main.yaml
 │   ├── templates/
 │   │   ├── vhost.conf.j2
 │   ├── vars/
 │   │   ├── main.yaml
 │   ├── defaults/
 │   │   ├── main.yaml
 │   ├── meta/
 │   │   ├── main.yaml
```

### 2️⃣ Define Role Tasks
📌 roles/webapp/tasks/main.yaml

```yaml
- name: Install required packages
  yum:
    name: "{{ packages }}"
    state: present

- name: Start and enable services
  service:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: started
    enabled: yes
  loop: "{{ services }}"

- name: Deploy Web Application
  copy:
    src: /home/user/app/
    dest: /var/www/html/
    owner: apache
    group: apache
    mode: 0755

- name: Configure Virtual Host
  template:
    src: vhost.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/httpd/conf.d/app.conf
  notify: Restart Apache
```

### 3️⃣ Define Role Variables
📌 roles/webapp/vars/main.yaml

```yaml
packages:
  - httpd
  - php
  - php-mysql
  - mysql-server

services:
  - httpd
  - mysqld
```

### 4️⃣ Define Handlers
📌 roles/webapp/handlers/main.yaml

```yaml
- name: Restart Apache
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: restarted
```

### 5️⃣ Define Virtual Host Template
📌 roles/webapp/templates/vhost.conf.j2

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
    <Directory /var/www/html>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

### 6️⃣ Create the Main Playbook
📌 site.yaml

```yaml
- name: Deploy Web Application
  hosts: webservers
  roles:
    - webapp
```

### 7️⃣ Run the Playbook

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini site.yaml
```

### ✅ Benefits of Using Roles Over Tasks:
- ✔ Reusability – You can reuse the webapp role for different applications.
- ✔ Modularity – Tasks, handlers, and variables are well-organized.
- ✔ Scalability – Easy to manage and modify without breaking the whole playbook.

### How Ansible Roles Automatically Work Without Explicit Includes
When you define a role under the roles: section in a playbook (e.g., site.yaml), Ansible automatically looks for specific files in the role’s predefined directory structure. 
This is because Ansible follows a convention-based approach for roles.

#### How Ansible Finds Role Files Automatically
When you specify a role in a playbook:

```yaml
- name: Deploy Web Application
  hosts: webservers
  roles:
    - webapp
```

Ansible automatically looks for these files inside roles/webapp/:

## How do you use Jinja2 templating in Ansible?
### Where Can You Use Jinja2 in Ansible?
- 1️⃣ Templates for configuration files
- 2️⃣ Dynamic variable interpolation
- 3️⃣ Conditional execution (when statements, if-else)
- 4️⃣ Looping (for loops in templates)
- 5️⃣ Filters and expressions for data manipulation

<details>
#### Jinja2 Templating in Ansible for Kubernetes (K8s) – Real-world Examples
Ansible can use Jinja2 templates to dynamically generate Kubernetes YAML manifests for deployments, services, ConfigMaps, etc. This helps in deploying applications with different configurations for staging, production, or multiple clusters.

You need to deploy an Nginx application in multiple Kubernetes environments (staging, production) with different replica counts.

### 1️⃣ Define Variables
📌 File: vars/k8s_vars.yaml

```yaml
app_name: nginx
namespace: default
image_version: latest
replica_count: "{{ 3 if environment == 'production' else 1 }}"
```

### 🔹 Dynamic Scaling:
- ✔ Production → 3 replicas
- ✔ Staging → 1 replica

### 2️⃣ Create the Jinja2 Kubernetes Deployment Template
📌 File: templates/nginx-deployment.yaml.j2

```jinja
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ app_name }}-deployment
  namespace: {{ namespace }}
  labels:
    app: {{ app_name }}
spec:
  replicas: {{ replica_count }}
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: {{ app_name }}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: {{ app_name }}
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: {{ app_name }}
          image: nginx:{{ image_version }}
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

### 🔹 What’s Dynamic Here?
- ✔ app_name, namespace, replica_count, and image_version are injected dynamically.
- ✔ Different environments (staging/production) will have different replica counts.

### 3️⃣ Deploy Using Ansible Playbook
📌 File: deploy-k8s.yaml

```yaml
- name: Deploy Nginx to Kubernetes
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Generate Kubernetes deployment file
      template:
        src: templates/nginx-deployment.yaml.j2
        dest: /tmp/nginx-deployment.yaml

    - name: Apply Deployment to Kubernetes
      command: kubectl apply -f /tmp/nginx-deployment.yaml
```

### 🔹 How It Works?
- ✔ Ansible's template module dynamically generates the YAML file.
- ✔ Runs kubectl apply to deploy the generated manifest.

### 4️⃣ Run the Playbook for Staging

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini deploy-k8s.yaml -e "environment=staging"
```

### 🎯 Generated Staging File (/tmp/nginx-deployment.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

✅ Only 1 replica in staging

### 5️⃣ Run the Playbook for Production

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini deploy-k8s.yaml -e "environment=production"
```

### 🎯 Generated Production File (/tmp/nginx-deployment.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

✅ 3 replicas in production

## How do you handle errors in Ansible playbooks? (ignore_errors, rescue, failed_when)

<details>
### Playbook with Error Handling for Kubernetes Deployment
📌 File: deploy_k8s_app.yaml

```yaml
- name: Deploy an Application to Kubernetes
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    namespace: "production"
    deployment_file: "/tmp/app-deployment.yaml"

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Kubernetes Namespace Exists
      command: kubectl get namespace {{ namespace }}
      register: ns_status
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Create Namespace if Missing
      command: kubectl create namespace {{ namespace }}
      when: ns_status.rc != 0

    - name: Apply Kubernetes Deployment
      block:
        - name: Deploy Application
          command: kubectl apply -f {{ deployment_file }} -n {{ namespace }}
          register: deploy_result
          retries: 3
          delay: 5
          until: deploy_result.rc == 0
      rescue:
        - name: Print error if deployment fails
          debug:
            msg: "Deployment failed after multiple retries!"
          failed_when: true  # Ensure playbook fails

    - name: Verify Pods are Running
      command: kubectl get pods -n {{ namespace }} --no-headers | grep Running
      register: pod_status
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Fail if No Running Pods Found
      fail:
        msg: "No running pods found in {{ namespace }}!"
      when: "'Running' not in pod_status.stdout"
```
### Explanation
- ✔ ignore_errors: yes for Namespace Check → Avoid failure if the namespace is missing.
- ✔ retries & until for kubectl apply → Retries deployment if it fails.
- ✔ rescue block → If retries fail, show an error message and fail the playbook.
- ✔ grep Running to check pod status → Ensures at least one pod is running.

## rescue & block → Try-Catch Like Error Handling
Used to handle failures more gracefully, like try-except in Python.

block: Wraps a set of tasks.

rescue: Executes only if a task in block fails.

always: Runs regardless of success or failure (like a finally block).

Use case: When you want to attempt an alternative action if a task fails.

📌 Example: If yum package installation fails, try installing with dnf.

```yaml
- name: Install package with error handling
  block:
    - name: Install package using yum
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
  rescue:
    - name: Try installing with dnf instead
      command: dnf install -y httpd
  always:
    - name: Ensure service is running
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
```
