Ansible block is used to group multiple tasks together inside a playbook. It helps in:

✅ Structuring tasks for better readability.

✅ Error handling by defining rescue and always sections.

✅ Applying a common when, become, or vars condition to multiple tasks.


### Better Error Handling (rescue & always)
```yaml
- name: Setup FluxCD resources
  block:
    - name: Create resource directory
      file:
        path: "{{ fluxcd_resource_dir }}"
        state: directory

    - name: Apply FluxCD manifest
      command: kubectl apply -f fluxcd.yaml
  rescue:
    - name: Handle failure
      debug:
        msg: "FluxCD setup failed!"
  always:
    - name: Cleanup temp files
      file:
        path: /tmp/temp_fluxcd
        state: absent
```
### 

```yaml
- name: Set up a new user with SSH access
  block:
    - name: Create the user
      user:
        name: devops
        state: present
        shell: /bin/bash

    - name: Add SSH key
      authorized_key:
        user: devops
        key: "{{ lookup('file', 'id_rsa.pub') }}"
        state: present

    - name: Grant sudo access
      copy:
        dest: "/etc/sudoers.d/devops"
        content: "devops ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL"
  become: yes
  when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
  tags: setup_user
```
**Why block here?**

- become: yes ensures all tasks run with sudo.
- when: ansible_os_family == "Debian" applies to the entire block (only runs on Debian-based systems).
- tags: setup_user makes it easier to run only this block with ansible-playbook --tags setup_user.

## Defining Variables Inside a Block in Ansible
You can define variables in a block using set_fact, and these variables can then be used in the tasks within that block.

```yaml
- name: Set up user and SSH key
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Create a new user with dynamic variables
      block:
        - set_fact:
            username: "devops"
            ssh_key_file: "/home/devops/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
        
        - name: Create the user
          user:
            name: "{{ username }}"
            state: present

        - name: Add SSH key to user
          authorized_key:
            user: "{{ username }}"
            key: "{{ lookup('file', ssh_key_file) }}"
            state: present
```
### Explanation of the Above Example:

set_fact:

The set_fact module sets variables username and ssh_key_file within the block.
These variables are only available within this block.

Variable Usage:

You can then reference {{ username }} and {{ ssh_key_file }} in the subsequent tasks within the block.

Scope:

Variables defined using set_fact in a block are only available inside that block. They won’t be available outside the block, making them useful for more localized or dynamic logic.

### Example: Using when with Variables Inside a Block
You can also use variables to control the flow of tasks in a block, such as using when to conditionally execute tasks based on the variable values.

```yaml
- name: Set up user and manage SSH key
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Manage user and key
      block:
        - set_fact:
            username: "devops"
            ssh_key_file: "/home/devops/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
        
        - name: Create the user
          user:
            name: "{{ username }}"
            state: present
        
        - name: Add SSH key to user
          authorized_key:
            user: "{{ username }}"
            key: "{{ lookup('file', ssh_key_file) }}"
            state: present
          when: username == "devops"  # Conditional task execution

      # These tasks will only execute if 'username' is 'devops'.
```
