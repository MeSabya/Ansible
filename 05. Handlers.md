## What are Handlers in Ansible?
- Handlers are special tasks that execute only when notified.
- They are triggered by other tasks only if a change occurs.
- Commonly used for restarting services, reloading configurations, etc.

## Key Features of Handlers
âœ” Triggered only when notified (unlike normal tasks that always run).

âœ” Execute at the end of a play (unless forced earlier).

âœ” Can be reused across multiple tasks.

âœ” Named uniquely for referencing (notify: <handler_name>).

### Examples of handlers 

```yaml
- name: Copy Nginx configuration file
  copy:
    src: nginx.conf
    dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  notify: Restart Nginx   # Notifies handler if file changes

- name: Ensure Nginx is installed
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present

handlers:
  - name: Restart Nginx
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: restarted
```

### Example: Restart Multiple Services Together

```yaml
- name: Update application code
  git:
    repo: "https://github.com/example/app.git"
    dest: "/var/www/app"
  notify: Restart Services

handlers:
  - name: Restart Services
    service:
      name: apache2
      state: restarted
    service:
      name: redis-server
      state: restarted
```
### Example: Force Immediate Execution of Handler
ðŸ”¸ By default, handlers run at the end of the playbook.

ðŸ”¸ Use meta: flush_handlers to force immediate execution.

```yaml
- name: Copy database config
  copy:
    src: db.conf
    dest: /etc/mysql/my.cnf
  notify: Restart MySQL

- name: Force restart of MySQL immediately
  meta: flush_handlers

handlers:
  - name: Restart MySQL
    service:
      name: mysql
      state: restarted
```
