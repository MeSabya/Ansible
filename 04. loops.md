### Example-1

Suppose you want to create multiple user accounts on a set of servers. You can use a loop to iterate over a list of usernames and create a user for each one.

```yaml
---
- name: Create User Accounts
  hosts: servers
  become: yes  # Run tasks with elevated privileges (sudo)

  vars:
    user_accounts:
      - alice
      - bob
      - charlie

  tasks:
    - name: Create User Accounts
      user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      with_items: "{{ user_accounts }}"
```
In this example:

user_accounts is a list of usernames that you want to create.

The with_items directive is used to loop over each item in the user_accounts list.

The user module is used to create a user for each item in the list. The with_items syntax has been deprecated in Ansible 2.5 and later. You should use the loop keyword instead.

### Example-2

```yaml
---
- name: Install Packages
  hosts: servers
  become: yes

  vars:
    packages_to_install:
      - nginx
      - git
      - python3

  tasks:
    - name: Install Packages
      apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop: "{{ packages_to_install }}"
```
